# Coursera IBM Data Science Capstone Project - Report

## 1. Introduction / Business Problem

### Assessing the distribution / usage of Foursquare in different German cities

#### Background
Foursquare is relying on users to add, describe, rate,... places.
It is **not** a widely used service in Germany.
Therefore, the database is probably not as big as some competitors' databases.

#### Business problem

What can a data scientist / user expect from a comparison of German cities of different size and location using Foursquare?
Which types of venues can a data scientist / user use for his comparison at all?

Can one identify cities or clusters of cities for promoting the use of Foursquare to widen the user base?
Can one identify types of venues that are under-represented and that should be added to the Foursquare database?

##### Stakeholders

The two stakeholders this data science project will target are:

1. the "common data scientist"
  * to decide whether he/she wants to use Foursquare for comparing cities in Germany
  * ... or to limit his/her comparison to cities with specific population size or location
  
2. the "Foursquare advertising team"
  * to select cities in which to promote the usage of Foursquare
  * to select types / categories of venues that need to be added to the Foursquare database (e.g. by nudging Foursquare users to add them)

## 1. Introduction / Business Problem

### Assessing distribution / usage of Foursquare in German cities

#### Background
Foursquare relies on users to add, describe, rate,... places.
It is not a widely used service in Germany. Therefore, the database is probably not as big as some competitors' databases.

#### Business problem

How much and what type of Foursquare Places data can a data scientist use to compare German cities?

Can one cluster the cities by their population size, location and Foursquare data into groups to enable data scientist to decide which cities are better suited for comparison than others?

In which properties do the city clusters differ?

Can one select cities within these clusters that should be targeted with an ad campaign to promote the usage of Foursquare?

##### Stakeholders

The two stakeholders this data science project will target are:

1. the "common data scientist"
  * to decide whether he/she wants to use Foursquare for comparing cities in Germany
  * ... or to limit his/her comparison to (clusters of) cities with specific properties (population size, location, venues,...)
  
2. the "Foursquare advertising team"
  * to select cities in which to promote the usage of Foursquare
